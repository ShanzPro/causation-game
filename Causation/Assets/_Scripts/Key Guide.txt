Hiya here's a little guide because of the big refactor.
Many of the character related scripts were deleted and condensed.
The following were removed:
enemyshootingscript, reticlepointer, demoman, playermovement, shooting

_CharacterScripts contains:
characterbase - implements all of the shooting/attacks required for character attacks
playercontroller - imeplements characterbase and uses playermovement

EnemySpecific contains enemy and specific enemies (imagine a boss or whatever)


ManagementScripts contains:
BulletScript - behavior is still wonky but works for now

CameraBehavior

ContactDamage

Interactable

Parallax

SceneTransition

UXScripts
HealthBar

MenuController

OptionsController
